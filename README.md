# iEvoBio 2022: Build It Right From the Start

This year's event will occur after the meeting on June 24, from 9 am to 5 pm at the
Huntington Convention Center. Registration will take place via the main meeting registration [website](https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/).


## In Brief

## The Meeting

We will have four sessions, two in the morning and two in the evening. Scheduling
is still somewhat in flux. But broadly, we will be having an NSF session about applying for funding as a computational researcher. We will also have a session
on lessons from successful young PIs at a variety of institution types (research-focused, teaching-focused), as well as some folks who are now hiring and mentoring young PIs. What did they do well? What do they wish they had done
when setting up a computational evolutionary biology lab?

Our education session this year will focus on the connection between teaching and
research. How can we effectively onboard undergraduates into our labs via coursework? But also, how can we do research with our classes? Domain-based education research and pedagogy research will feature prominently in this session.

Finally, we will have a bird-of-a-feather discussion. Previous years have asked for more time to do structured discussions and networking on the above topics. So, we're
giving the people what they want.

# Birds of a Feather

Every year, iEvoBio has lively discussions. Is something on your mind about doing computational evolutionary biology? An issue with how to git your git workflow working? Trouble grading student code notebooks? [File an issue](https://github.com/ievobio/2022iEvoBio/issues), and we'll put it on our end-of-the-day Birds of a Feather discussion roster! This is an open environment for researchers, educators, and students to connect and foster discussion.
